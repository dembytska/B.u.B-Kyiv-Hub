# B.u.B-Kyiv-Hub
Site for a gym.

Brief description of the idea.
B.u.B Kyiv Hub is a website created for a sports club to post all the necessary
information about the facility and attract new customers through further website advertising.

Prototype. Work on the prototype was carried out on the Figma online platform.
The creation of a prototype is necessary for presentation to the customer,
to demonstrate how the site will look and how the interaction with the user
will take place (clicking buttons, switching from one screen to another, etc.).
At this stage, amendments are made to the project (as many times as necessary,
until the most final version is approved), before proceeding to the software implementation of the project.

Software implementation.
Creation of a site (using all the necessary technologies, modules and frameworks)
that will correspond to the appearance and functions of what was presented and approved as a prototype.
The site I created consists of two pages.

Main page of the site. HOME, ABOUT, MEMBERSHIP, GALLERY, FAQ, CONTACT â€“ anchor links to sections of the main page,
where information about the sports club (brief overview), about the number of coaches and their specializations
is posted; image gallery (carousel), answers to the most frequently asked questions about the institution
and contact form 1, by filling in which the user can ask a question and get an answer to it.
BUY NOW is the second page of the site, which contains more detailed information about
subscriptions (their price and what they include). There is also a form where a
potential customer can reserve any of the season tickets to pay for it
after agreeing the details with the commercial department.
